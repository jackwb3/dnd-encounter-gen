### This is still being developed!
### It is not fully functional!
  
This project was started as a way to try out PyQt5 and solve a long standing problem for DMs in Dungeons and Dragons. DnD 5e Monsters and Rules are used in this project.  
The goal of this project is to easily be able to generate a list of random encounters during long or short overland journeys according to the terrain and mode of transportation. The encounters generated will include all types of possible encounters from friendly to hostile, and in logical proportions. Friendly and neutral encounters will be simply enumerated by type and encounters with monsters/animals will be fully generated including individually enumerated enemies with hit die, armor class, weapons, damage, spells, and abilities.
